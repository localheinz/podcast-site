### Synopsis

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with voice of the PHP community, the one and only [Cal Evans](http://paul-m-jones.com), about one of his books - [Going Pro](https://leanpub.com/goingpro).

We talk about a range of things, including what motivated him to write the book, how the book's been received, people Cal believes are excellent examples of professional programmers, **and much, much more**.
