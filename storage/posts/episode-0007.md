### Synopsis

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with Troy Hunt, (insert Twitter bio) about....

We talk about a range of tools freelancers, *as well as full time employees*, can use, including social media, speaking at conferences, and getting on podcasts, to build a reputation and brand for themselves, even if they're just starting out.
