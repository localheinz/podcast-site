### Synopsis

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with the wonderful Erika Heidi, where we talk about technical writing. We also talk about simplifying deployment, naturally, with her preferred tools of Vagrant and Ansible.

It was great to learn from her about what it's like to be a technical writer, as well as her tips and tricks for writing in a way that developers will know exactly what they'll need to do. That way, they'll get the most from our technical posts.

We also talk about getting in to public speaking, whether that's hour long talks, or shorter lightning talks.

As always, there's so much value, so much that you'll get out of it. Grab your favorite beverage, sit back, and get ready to grow.
