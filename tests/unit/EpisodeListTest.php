### Synopsis

In this, the first episode, Matt talks about what lead to the podcast getting started who motivated him and inspired him to get started. After that, he discusses a fantastic book that all freelancers should read, one which explains how you need to approach freelancing if you want to succeed, and you want to keep your sanity; it's called the E-Myth Revisited. Finally, Matt discusses why networking is essential to success, and some of the mistakes that some of techies make.
